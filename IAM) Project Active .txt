1. Project Overview
This project focused on deploying an on-premises Active Directory Domain Controller to provide centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) for CyberTech Solutions.
The implementation included domain setup, client integration, creation of Organizational Units (OUs) aligned to regional offices, security group design, user provisioning, and enforcement of access control policies using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

2. Company IT Structure
The simulated environment reflected a small IT services firm with distributed offices:
? 1 x Windows Server - Domain Controller (AD DS + DNS)
? 2 x Client PCs - Windows 8.1 and Windows 10
? Three regional OUs - UK, US, and ABUJA
? Departmental Groups - Created within each OU to represent business functions

3. Project Objectives
? Deploy Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for centralized IAM.
? Configure regional Organizational Units (OUs) to mirror company structure.
? Provision security groups to manage access by department.
? Create user accounts and assign them to relevant groups.
? Apply Group Policies to enforce access restrictions.
? Demonstrate IAM governance in an on-premises enterprise setup.

5. Domain Configuration
? Domain Name: Cybertech.local
? Server Name: CYBERTECH
? Static IP: 10.0.2.4
? Roles Installed:
? Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
? DNS Server

6. Organizational Units (OUs) and Groups
The directory structure was created as follows:
CyberTech.local
            Organisational Unit: UK
¦   +-- Group: IT
¦   +-- Group: Sales

             Organisational Unit: US
¦   +-- Group: Procurements
¦   +-- Group: Laboratory

             Organisational Unit: Abuja
    +-- Group: Finance
    +-- Group: Consultation

7. Users and Group Memberships
Two test users were provisioned to demonstrate IAM principles:
Username
OUs
Group Membership
      Assigned Policy
Bill.IT@cybertech.local
UK OU
IT
Remove clock from system notification area.
Biola.finance@cybertech.local
ABUJA
Finance
Unable to shutdown

8. Group Policy (GPO) Implementation
Two GPOs were created and linked to specific users through security filtering:
1. GPO Name: Remove Calendar Display
Linked To: UK OU (IT User - Bill)
Policy:
User Configuration => Administrative Templates 
Result: Bill cannot view or enabled Clock and calendar on the assigned PC..

2. GPO Name: NoShutdown
3. Linked To: ABUJA OU (Finance User - Biola)
Policy:
Computer Configuration => Administrative=> Templates => Start Menu and Taskbar => Remove and prevent access to the Shut Down, Restart, Sleep, and Hibernate commands
Result: Biola cannot shut down the assigned PC.

10. Key Takeaways
Successfully implemented an IAM framework on Active Directory.
Mapped business structure (regions and departments) into OUs and groups.
Demonstrated access control enforcement using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
Learned how to provision and manage users, groups, and security policies.
Applied identity governance principles in a real-world simulated enterprise environment.
